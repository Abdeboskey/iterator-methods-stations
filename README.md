# Paired Practice Time
The best way to get comfortable with these methods is to practice them, so we will!

You'll be with a partner in a breakout room to work through some practice problems. Assign one person to be the driver and the other to be the navigator. It might be helpfulful to switch these roles off and on so you have the opportunity to be both!

## Instructions
1. Choose one of the array prototypes to start with and open the markdown file (example: `filter.md`)
2. Copy the data and prompt into a new REPL
3. Work through the exercises with your partner
4. Repeat!
