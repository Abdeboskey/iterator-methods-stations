# Paired Practice Time!
The best way to get comfortable with these methods is to practice them, so we will!

You'll be with a partner in a breakout room to work through some practice problems. Assign one person to be the driver and the other to be the navigator. It might be helpfulful to switch these roles off and on so you have the opportunity to be both!

## Instructions
Start with #1
Have the driver fork a copy of the REPL
Work through problems together (you'll have 15 minutes for each REPL)
