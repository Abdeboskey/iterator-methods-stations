# .sort

1. What does `.sort` do?
2. Is the original array modified?
3. How many arguments does `.sort` take?
4. How many arguments does the _callback function_ take?
5. Which arguments are required (for both the method and its callback)?
6. Does the callback need a return value? If so, what needs to be returned?

Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns an array with even and odd numbers separated.

```javascript
var numbers = [1,6,2,5,10,15,13]

sortEvensAndOdds(numbers) // => [2,6,10,1,5,13,15]

```
