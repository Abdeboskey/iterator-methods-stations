# .reduce

1. What does `.reduce` do?
2. Is the original array modified?
3. How many arguments does `.reduce` take?
4. How many arguments does the _callback function_ take?
5. Which arguments are required (for both the method and its callback)?
6. Does the callback need a return value? If so, what needs to be returned?


Given an array of numbers, write a function that returns the product of all the numbers.

```javascript
var numbers = [1,2,5,7]

getProduct(numbers) // => 70

```
